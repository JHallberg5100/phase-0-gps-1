# Reflection

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Primarily i was struggling with proper syntax  for git commands and steps for pushing to GitHub
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
the same concepts that I was struggling with previously
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Asked about what I had been confused about
What still confuses you about Git?
Although the concepts I was confused about were clarified I still need to continue to review them, so I'm not necessarily confused but not completely fluent in the Git Hub syntax
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
The pairing was fun. I enjoyed my  partner and the guide was helpful without doing the work for us
