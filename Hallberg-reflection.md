#Git Reflection
  * I was struggling with comitting and merge branch managment.  Also I was having issues figuring out how the git pushing worked.
  * Mostly all of them honestly.
  * Alot of clarification.  Going over commands alot, and general work space set up.
  * Git seems to make alot more sense to me now.  I cannot think of any outstanding topic or I would have asked it.
  * It was pleasant overall.  Its a good starting off point and ramming the concept of git into my graymatter.
